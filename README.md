# BlackHoleSim
Using the p5.js library, I embarked on a fascinating journey to simulate a black hole, a celestial object known for its immense gravitational pull that even light cannot escape. Leveraging p5.js's versatile canvas and drawing capabilities, I started by creating a central point to represent the black hole's singularity. To mimic its gravitational effect, I implemented physics algorithms that bend the trajectories of particles as they approach the singularity, ultimately causing them to be "captured" by the black hole.
